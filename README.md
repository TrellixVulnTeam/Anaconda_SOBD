# anaconda

My custom [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/) repository, to makes it compatible with [Cloudera](http://www.cloudera.com), you should clone this repository to the directory of `/opt/cloudera/parcels/`.

If you want a online development environment, just type:
```
/opt/cloudera/parcels/Anaconda/bin/jupyter notebook
```
